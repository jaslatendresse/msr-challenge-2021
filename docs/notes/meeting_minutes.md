## Selected research questions: 
1. How many of the bugs were captured by CI?
2. If the bug was caught by CI, was it fixed (immediately, ignored, etc...)?
3. How do bugs caught by CI compare to those not caught by CI? How long to they stay in the code base before they get fixed? 

## Validation
Run queries on the dataset dumped in sqlite and validate the results by searching the commits on GH and make sure they contain what they should. Document this validation. 
## Next 
With the small dataset, narrow down the number of projects we will select for the research. 

Project characteristics: 
- 10-30 sizable projects
- Use of Travis CI
- Young projects for mature CI usage
- Have a baseline of less than 5-6 years of CI use. 
- Have been using CI from the beginning to ensure the commit is covered by CI. 

## TravisTorrent
https://travistorrent.testroots.org/page_access/ 

Get projects from TravisTorrent and look if projects from the dataset are part of them. If so, select them. 

Then, for each selected project, ensure that they have at least one of each of the 16 bug template.

## Brainstorming

Find the commit that introduced the bug. 
- When the bug was introduced? When was the bug fixed?
- Did CI capture the bug? How long between "when the bug was introduced and when it was fixed"?

Some further ideas:
- Compare CI results before fix and after fix. 
- It could be that CI caught the bug between the introduction and the fix. 
- Was the CI effective? How long did the bug stay in the code? 

## Next Step

1. Find projects in commit guru, if not there add them. 
2. Download CSV files + merge them + create table from them with python in sqlite db.
3. Query tables to find how much of our commit fixing (corrective commits) data is in commit guru.

Possible tools: 
http://pure.tudelft.nl/ws/portalfiles/portal/46282428/main.pdf or commit guru (docker). 

What we are interested in next: 
- % of commits in MSR dataset (untouched) that have triggered CI builds 
- % of commits that commit guru finds them as bug fixes.

## Brainstorming 

Quantitive analysis

- How many commits triggered the CI (must be a PR)? 
- How many are part of the PR (in the list)? 
- How long the bugs stay in the code before they're fixed? (if long time, then maybe not risky?) 

Qualitative analysis

- Why CI pipeline doesn't not catch these bugs? 
- When bugs fixed, are tests added to the code? 
- Is the bug covered by a test? 

Include commits that are not part of the CI table. 

## Questions

- What % of bugs are caught by the CI? 
- If not caught, why? 

## Next Step 

- Set up document to work on the paper
- Set up the pipeline for the latex template (GitHub actions) 

# 2021-01-05

Validate the 15 commits that are not PR nor appear in the list gh_commits_in_push (just to make sure).

Panda explode - replicate row for each value of the list you have in one column (For the fixed_by column in the commit guru set)

Next step: find out how long do bugs stay in the code (from selected_sstubs - the 830 distinct commits) with the fixed_by column from commit guru.

## Next step + brainstorming
- Start gathering the data, write it in the paper (answering the questions) to define the scope. 
- More interesting if a bug was caught by the CI. 
  - We have a timeline of the bug fix, we can compare the CI pipeline of the timeline before and after the fix. 
  - Use travis torrent data set, is there a test passing or failing after the fix? 
  - Was it caught? Did devs add tests to catch it after? 

Methodology - do we trust the results? 
Conclusions - are our findings relevant? 

Next:

- Find bugs not caught by the CI. 
- Start sketching the methology, make the tables (put what you find interesting, results answering the questions, etc)
- Related works (from this summer) to be included in the introduction. 
- Schema (maybe) overview of our approach 
- Consider doing some visualization (plots, graphs) 
- Classify findings by bugType
