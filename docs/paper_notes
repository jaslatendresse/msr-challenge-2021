# Initial Investigation

## Guidelines 
Research goal (What is the problem being solved/investigated?)
Motivation (Why is the problem important?)
Approach/Methodology (How did they solve/investigate the problem?)
Empirical Findings/Experimental Results (What is the outcome of the study?)
Conclusions (What did we learn from the study?)

## Goal
Provide a dataset large enough to study the recall of repair techniques for simple bugs (one-line bugs for example) → percentage of real-world bugs that can be repaired by one of the templates. 

## Motivation
Program repair is important but difficult. We need an effective way to evaluate and study program repair techniques for simple bugs because simple bugs (such as one-line bugs) are amongst the most common, yet difficult bugs to see because they are latent (they do not appear until an event triggers them). Program repair is one of the core tasks in software maintenance. It requires to analyze failed executions, locate the cause of the fault, come up with a bug fix, validate that the fault has been corrected (with unit test for example) all this without introducing a new bug. This process is costly because it requires effort and time this is why most development teams will adopt automatic repair. A major concern in the industry is that such automation is required to have high precision without risking achieving high enough recall (have a false positive rate as low as possible for example). To achieve this (maintain high precision with adequate recall) is to focus on repairing simple bugs that fall into a set of templates. 

## Approach
Provide two datasets:
- Small dataset containing 25,539 single-statement bug-fix changes mined from 100 popular open-source java maven projects. 
- Large dataset containing 153,652 single-statement bug-fix changes mined from 1,000 popular open-source java projects. 
- The bug fix changes are annotated by whether they match any of the 16 bug templates. The templates aim at extracting bugs that compile both before and after repair → very difficult to detect manually, but very easy and simple to fix. 

To obtain high quality datasets, java projects with high popularity were selected.
