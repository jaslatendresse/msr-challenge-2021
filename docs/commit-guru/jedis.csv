default order of Redis SortedSet as long as the precision issue does not come
into play.

Test codes are added for this feature.

* Test added for multiple elements with same score.

* Test ByteArrayComparatorTest where one array is prefix of another.
Also tests are changed to accept any positive or negative value, not just +1 or -1.

call waiting for messages or subscription notifications.  Thread B is now free
to call additional methods on JedisPubSub to change the current subscriptions
that thread A is waiting for.  Essentially Thread A will do reads on the
socket and Thread B will do writes.

An issue occurs in that while Thread A is doing reads, in the
getObjectMultiBulkReply() method there is an implicit flush() call.  This
means both Thread A and Thread B may do a write to the socket.  Under this
situation if Thread A does a flush while Thread B is writing the internal
buffer will be corrupted.  The fix is to make thread A never call flush().
This allows Thread A to be solely reads and Thread B to be solely writes.

Additionally since Thread B is sending commands, the internal pipeline count
is incremented and never decremented.  So when Thread A terminates it's read
it resets the pipeline count.

We would like to add the ability to specify the database number on the pool config. We have a number of integration/functional tests in different projects using redis and would like to keep them separate. Setting up a number of redis server instances on different ports would become unwieldy.

The changes add the ability to specify the database number for jedis pools with associated test. I did not add the ability to create a raw jedis connection with a database number because the current implementation of pool creates the jedis object first, then if a password exists it calls the auth command. However, if a password is required, then the select command on the jedis create would fail. I also did not change the shard constructor of jedis to use a database number (which actually does have the constructor of jedis call the auth command). 

I could clean up the implementation to always have the jedis constructor call auth if a password exists, then select the database if it is non-zero, and changing sharding info to contain a database config value. Let me know if you want me to make these bigger changes.

The subscribe and psubscribe operations call setTimeoutInfinite() since they never return on their own. If the Redis server goes away without closing the connection, the connection can hang indefinitely. Turning on keep-alive will allow the connection to eventually timeout and attempt reconnection.

Note that keepalive must also be enabled on your server, see the Linux HOWTOs on how to do this.
